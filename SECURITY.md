Here's the adapted Vulnerability Disclosure Policy in markdown format for GSA:

# GSA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

*Last Updated: February 14, 2025*

## Introduction

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information. This policy provides security researchers with clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and submitting discovered vulnerabilities to GSA.

This policy outlines:
- Systems and types of research covered
- How to submit vulnerability reports
- Expected timelines for public disclosure of vulnerabilities

We encourage responsible disclosure of potential vulnerabilities in our systems.

## Authorization

If you make a good faith effort to comply with this policy during your security research, we will:
- Consider your research to be authorized
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly
- Not recommend or pursue legal action related to your research

Should legal action be initiated by a third party against you for activities conducted in accordance with this policy, we will make this authorization known.

## Guidelines

Under this policy, "research" means activities where you:

- Notify us immediately upon discovery of a real or potential security issue
- Avoid privacy violations, system disruption, and data manipulation
- Use exploits only to confirm vulnerabilities
- Provide reasonable time for resolution before public disclosure
- Submit high-quality, actionable reports

**Important:** If you discover sensitive data (including PII, financial information, or proprietary information), you must:
1. Stop testing immediately
2. Notify us promptly
3. Not disclose the data to anyone else

## Test Methods Not Authorized

- Network denial of service (DoS or DDoS) tests
- Physical testing (office access, tailgating)
- Social engineering (phishing, vishing)
- Any non-technical vulnerability testing

## Scope

This policy applies to these GSA systems and services:

- *.gsa.gov
- Explicitly listed GSA-operated services
- Public-facing GSA digital services

*Note: Systems not explicitly listed are excluded from scope. Vulnerabilities in vendor systems should be reported directly to those vendors.*
